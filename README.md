Random number generator API built using flask

## To setup

I developed this on an ubuntu machine, used virtual environment to setup up flask. Installed virtual environment using `sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv`. In the project root i also ran `virtualenv flask` followed by `flask/bin/pip install flask`. This installed flask in the directory. If your `./run.py` does not have execute permissions please do execute `sudo chmod a+x run.py` to be able to run the application.
